            <h1>What is a NFT?</h1>
            <p class="lead">  NFT stands for "non-fungible token." A NFT is a digital asset that links ownership to unique
                physical or digital items, such as works of art, real estate, music, or videos.
                NFTs can be considered modern-day collectibles. They're bought and sold online, and represent a digital proof of ownership
                of any given item. NFT’s themselves are not cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency technology is used to create and acquire NFTs.
                Smart contracts are created with customized tokens which art is attached to. NFTs are securely recorded on a blockchain,Which ensures
                the asset is one-of-a-kind. The technology can also make it difficult to alter or counterfeit NFTs.
                Typically, non-fungible tokens are not divisible, in the same way that you cannot send someone part of a concert ticket;
                part of a concert ticket wouldn’t be worth anything on its own and would not be redeemable.If your interested in NFT's, Below are the steps necessary to get started.</p>

                <ul>
                <li class="mx-2 text-center">First you will need a vpn. A lot of NFT marketplaces are new and this technology is the wild west.
                    Protect yourself first by encrypting your network connection.</li>

                  <li>  I suggest this as a general best practice when dealing with sensitive information on the internet .</li>

                    <li>   There are plenty of different vpn's but just about any VPN will work. VPN’s are easy to use, and you want to connect to
                        your VPN before you start dealing with crypto or NFTs just to be safe.</li>

                    <li>  This is not necessary, But it is safe practice.</li>

                <ul>
                <li class="mx-2 text-center">Second you will need a meta-mask wallet, You can download here at <a href="">metamask.io</a>
                    This is your wallet where you will hold your NFT's.</li>

                 <li> When setting up your wallet it will give you a 12-word seed-phrase, (see picture above ). Physically write this down. Do not
                    save as a text file or screenshot, And never save them online or share them with anyone and put this somewhere very safe.</li>

                    <li>  If you get locked out or somehow lose one of your devices, you can use the seed phrase to recover your digital assets. This 12-words are
                    your keys to your wallet.</li>

                    <li>  If you lose these you will never be able to accesses this wallet or its contents, And  will be lost forever.</li>

                  <li>  This step is for web-browser.You will need MetaMask to connect
                    your crypto wallet to OpenSea a NFT marketplace.

                <li class="mx-2 text-center"> Ethereum is the cryptocurrency used to buy NFTs, so you’ll need to buy some.</li>

                  <li>  There are many exchanges to buy Ethereum on. Your easiest options if you are starting out are going to
                    be on Coinbase,crypto.com and Paypal.</li>

                <li>  After you have bought ethereum from an exchange you will need to transfer
                    it to your meta-mask wallet.</li>

                <li>  Just remember to get a little extra ethereum for gas.The Ethereum blockchain requires
                    Ethereum gas to keep itself running in the same way that a car needs gasoline to keep the lights on. All transactions
                    on the Ethereum network cost a certain amount of gas, depending on the current demand for gas and the size and speed
                    of the contract one is trying to execute.</li>

                        <li>  OpenSea will prompt you to connect with a wallet
                        immediately. If you’ve got a wallet like MetaMask installed, signing in is almost instant.</li>

                        <li>From the OpenSea homepage, navigate to the top right-hand corner of the site and clock on the wallet icon. OpenSea will prompt you to connect
                        to a wallet service of your choice. Once you’ve done that, your account is live!</li>

                        <li> After connecting a wallet, OpenSea
                        will bring you to your account’s profile page where you can view any NFTs you’ve collected, created, or favorited
                        on the site for potential purchase.Now you’re ready to roll and can explore the OpenSea marketplace with your wallet

                    <h2 class="text-center">Bidding on NFT'S</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <li  class="mx-2 text-center"> First, let’s get a tiny bit technical. When bidding on items, OpenSea uses a currency
                        called Wrapped Ethereum (WETH). The conversion rate from ETH to WETH is always 1:1, and you can downgrade any
                        unused WETH back to ETH. WETH is essentially the same as ETH, with some special utility. To make the conversion,
                        just go  to your  bids section of your OpenSea account.</li>

                        <li>  <strong>wrap ETH?</strong>
                        Why go to the trouble of using a separate currency for bids? No, it’s not because we want to. In short, wrapped
                        ETH allows the user to bid on many different  items using the same pool of Ether. So for example, as a user with 7 WETH,
                        I could place a 7 WETH offer on a bored ape, a 7 WETH offer on CoolCat, a 7 WETH offer on a Toadz .Or as  many CryptoDads
                        (or other items) as I  would like. The moment my first bid gets accepted, the other offers will be instantly invalidated
                        if I no longer have enough WETH in my account. Ok now let’s get bidding!</li>

                       <li>  Go to OpenSea.com, This
                        is the marketplace where to buy your NFT's.Search the nft you would like to bid on. To make a bid, hit “Make an offer” and
                        enter the amount that you’d be willing to pay for it</li>

                        <li>  Wrap your ETH After hitting “Continue”, we’ll
                        upgrade our ETH to WETH using the WETH station. Note that the first time you upgrade your ETH, you’ll need to make two
                        transactions (one to approve OpenSea’s use of WETH). You’ll only need to do that second transaction the first time you
                        upgrade!</li>

                        <li>    Make the bid After confirming those transactions, we’ll make an offer! Type in the
                        offer amount (and optionally set an expiration for your offer), and hit “Confirm Offer”.Hit “Sign” and your bid is
                        posted!</li>

                        <li>    Make tons of bids, for free! As mentioned, once you’ve converted some WETH, you’re off to the races!
                        You can now place as many offers (each one up to your amount of WETH) without paying a dime in gas . In other words, go crazy!</li>
