            <h1 id="one">What is a NFT?</h1>
            <p class="lead">  NFT stands for "non-fungible token." A NFT is a digital asset that links ownership to unique
                physical or digital items, such as works of art, real estate, music, or videos.
                NFTs can be considered modern-day collectibles. They're bought and sold online, and represent a digital proof of ownership
                of any given item. NFT’s themselves are not cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency technology is used to create and acquire NFTs.
                Smart contracts are created with customized tokens which art is attached to. NFTs are securely recorded on a blockchain,Which ensures
                the asset is one-of-a-kind. The technology can also make it difficult to alter or counterfeit NFTs.
                Typically, non-fungible tokens are not divisible, in the same way that you cannot send someone part of a concert ticket;
                part of a concert ticket wouldn’t be worth anything on its own and would not be redeemable.If your interested in NFT's, Below are the steps necessary to get started.</p>

                <li class="mx-2 text-center">First you will need a vpn. A lot of NFT marketplaces are new and this technology is the wild west.
                    Protect yourself first by encrypting your network connection.</li>

                  <li>  I suggest this as a general best practice when dealing with sensitive information on the internet .</li>

                    <li>   There are plenty of different vpn's but just about any VPN will work. VPN’s are easy to use, and you want to connect to
                        your VPN before you start dealing with crypto or NFTs just to be safe.</li>

                    <li>  This is not necessary, But it is safe practice.</li>

                <li class="mx-2 text-center">Second you will need a meta-mask wallet, You can download here at <a href="">metamask.io</a>
                    This is your wallet where you will hold your NFT's.</li>

                 <li> When setting up your wallet it will give you a 12-word seed-phrase, (see picture above ). Physically write this down. Do not
                    save as a text file or screenshot, And never save them online or share them with anyone and put this somewhere very safe.</li>

                    <li>  If you get locked out or somehow lose one of your devices, you can use the seed phrase to recover your digital assets. This 12-words are
                    your keys to your wallet.</li>

                    <li>  If you lose these you will never be able to accesses this wallet or its contents, And  will be lost forever.</li>

                <li class="mx-2 text-center"> Ethereum is the cryptocurrency used to buy NFTs, so you’ll need to buy some.</li>

                  <li>  There are many exchanges to buy Ethereum on. Your easiest options if you are starting out are going to
                    be on Coinbase,crypto.com and Paypal.</li>

                <li>  After you have bought ethereum from an exchange you will need to transfer
                    it to your meta-mask wallet.</li>

                <li>  Just remember to get a little extra ethereum for gas.The Ethereum blockchain requires
                    Ethereum gas to keep itself running in the same way that a car needs gasoline to keep the lights on. All transactions
                    on the Ethereum network cost a certain amount of gas, depending on the current demand for gas and the size and speed
                    of the contract one is trying to execute.</li>

                     <li class="mx-2 text-center"> <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea.io</a>  is the place you will buy your NFT'S. Since you have already
                         got a metamask wallet connecting it to OpenSea and building an account is a breeze.</li>

                        <li>  OpenSea will prompt you to connect with a wallet immediately. If you’ve got a wallet like MetaMask installed, signing in is almost
                            instant.</li>

                        <li>From the OpenSea homepage, navigate to the top right-hand corner of the site and clock on the wallet icon. OpenSea will prompt you
                            to connect your metamask wallet .(If your on a browser this is where metamask chrome extension is needed). Once you’ve done that,
                            your account is live!</li>

                        <li> After connecting a wallet, OpenSea will bring you to your account’s profile page where you can view any NFTs you’ve
                            collected, created, or favorited on the site for potential purchase.Now you’re ready to roll and can explore the OpenSea marketplace
                            with your wallet full of currency.</li>

                        <li>Find an NFT you’d like to purchase by exploring the marketplace. Review all the collected information about the NFT. For rarer and
                            collectible NFTs, there can be specific properties that are more valuable. And you’ll want to check the price history if you’re looking
                            to get into the trading aspect of the marketplace.</li>

                        <li> When you’re ready to make a purchase, simply click the “Buy Now” button.
                            You may be prompted by OpenSea to review a few details about your purchase before finalization. This is to ensure you know exactly
                            what you’re buying and to help you avoid scammers creating similar, but not authentic versions of popular NFTs. you will proceed to
                            a checkout pop-up where you can review the final cost of your purchase.</li>

                        <li> If everything looks good  click the “Checkout” button to finalize
                            your purchase. Hitting “Checkout” will open your wallet where you’ll get a final cost including applicable gas fees depending on how busy
                            the blockchain is. Click the “Confirm” button, and now you’re the proud  owner of an NFT. To see the NFT in your wallet, return to your
                            profile, and select “In Wallet” on the left side of the page. There might be a slight delay until it shows up due to processing time.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Bidding on NFT'S</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <li  class="mx-2 text-center"> First, let’s get a tiny bit technical. When bidding on items, OpenSea uses a currency
                        called Wrapped Ethereum (WETH). The conversion rate from ETH to WETH is always 1:1, and you can downgrade any
                        unused WETH back to ETH. WETH is essentially the same as ETH, with some special utility. To make the conversion,
                        just go  to your  bids section of your OpenSea account.</li>

                        <li>  <strong>wrap ETH?</strong>
                        Why go to the trouble of using a separate currency for bids? No, it’s not because we want to. In short, wrapped
                        ETH allows the user to bid on many different  items using the same pool of Ether. So for example, as a user with 7 WETH,
                        I could place a 7 WETH offer on a bored ape, a 7 WETH offer on CoolCat, a 7 WETH offer on a Toadz .Or as  many CryptoDads
                        (or other items) as I  would like. The moment my first bid gets accepted, the other offers will be instantly invalidated
                        if I no longer have enough WETH in my account. </li>

                       <li>  In OpenSea Search the nft you would like to bid on. To make a bid, hit “Make an offer” and
                        enter the amount that you’d be willing to pay for it</li>

                        <li>  Wrap your ETH After hitting “Continue”(If It's not already wrapped), we’ll
                        upgrade our ETH to WETH using the WETH station(see picture above). Note that the first time you upgrade your ETH, you’ll
                            need to make two transactions one to approve OpenSea’s use of WETH. You’ll only need to do that second transaction the
                            first time you upgrade.</li>

                        <li>    Make the bid After confirming those transactions, Click on "make offer" and type in the
                        offer amount (and optionally set an expiration for your offer), and hit “Confirm Offer”.Metamask will pop up a little window
                            Hit “Sign” and your bid is posted!</li>

                        <li>    After you can make all the bids you want for free. As mentioned, once you’ve converted some ETH to WETH, You can now plac
                            as many offers (each one up to your amount of WETH) without paying a dime in gas.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Selling your NFT'S</h2>
                    <p class="mx-2 text-center">Perhaps, you’ve decided to sell your collectible. Or that, even though you love
                        your new artwork, if someone will buy it at a higher price, you’ll part ways with it.selling NFTs on OpenSea is pretty straightforward.

                        Click the “green dot ” button in the upper right-hand corner of the NFT page.

                        Here, you’ll be prompted to choose the price, type of auction, and other preferences.
                        You can set your NFT as a fixed-price sale, or start an auction with a variety of settings including a
                        start price, price threshold, and timed expiration.

                        When you’ve worked out how you want your sales settings to look, click the “Post Your Listing” button.
                        There are no direct fees for listing one of your NFTs for sale, although there are some fees once the sale goes through, which are listed
                        out here. You’ll also be prompted to initialize your wallet if this is your first time selling. There might also be a few extra review prompts
                        to click through if the NFT you’re selling wasn’t minted on OpenSea.

                        After all of this, you’ll be asked to finalize the listing, confirm all the details, and post your NFT on the marketplace.
                        You can view all the NFTs you have up for sale by returning to your profile and selecting the “Activity” tab on the left-hand sidebar.
                        These are the basics of buying and selling NFTs on OpenSea.</p>
